Some classes in this folder inherit corresponding classes of python-urx.
Some classes are completely new, but using URscript of python-urx.
The secondary monitor of python-urx is rewritten for better use at the APS.
Since rtde code of python-urx does not support many feature required for 12ID operation, it is replaced with ur-rtde that I modified from an example code distributed by Universal Robot.
Please, download my another project "ur-rtde".

robot12idb.py is a code that I made for 12idb operation. Please do not distribute this out of the APS. Since it contains IP information of 12ID robots.
